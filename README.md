# Take home iOS project  - Upper Junior 

# Overview
This project encourages intentional open-mindedness. We want to see how you create when it’s all up to you. The project will be assessed based on your code quality, UI/UX, and the overall quality and feel of the app.

# Requirements 
1. The user can enter a GitHub username and retrieve a list of that username’s followers.
2. The user can search within these followers for a specific follower.
3. The user can tap on a follower from the list to get more information about the follower.
4. The user can save favorite username searches so they don’t have to type them every time. These searches need to persist between app launches.

# Additional Requirements:
1. 100% programmatic UI – No Storyboard.
2. No third party libraries

# Use github API – No authentication needed.
